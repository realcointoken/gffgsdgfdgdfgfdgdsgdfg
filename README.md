## 💸 PEPA IDO 💸

PEPA IDO is a platform that enables new Fuel projects to raise capital by releasing an Initial DEX Offering (IDO). An IDO is a decentralized fundraising technique that enables investors to purchase new tokens directly from a project’s smart contract, as opposed to a centralized exchange.


PEPA IDO is built with [Sway](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway), within [FuelVM](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs), on the fastest modular execution layer [Fuel](https://fuel-labs.ghost.io/introducing-fuel-the-fastest-modular-execution-layer/).
